# Employee Management System (EMS) - Web Application

## üìå Introduction

The **Employee Management System (EMS)** is a web-based application developed to manage employee-related data efficiently. It allows users to perform basic operations on employee records through a user-friendly interface.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Add new employee details like **name, date of birth, email, phone number**, etc.
- **View** a list of all employees stored in the system.
- **Update** existing employee information if there are any changes.
- **Delete** employee records that are no longer needed.

## üóÉÔ∏è How It Works

1. The user fills out a form with employee details.
2. These details are sent to the backend and stored in a **database**.
3. The system provides buttons or options to **insert**, **update**, or **delete** employee data.
4. All data is displayed in a tabular format for easy viewing and management.

This project is a simple example of how CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are implemented in a web application using modern web development technologies.

- These are the terms that you should know before knowing about how java would function in the backend.

### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): 
The foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. Understand request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), status codes (200, 404, 500), headers.

### REST (Representational State Transfer):
An architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs are stateless, client-server, cacheable, etc.

### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): 
A lightweight data-interchange format. Widely used for sending data between a backend and frontend.

### API (Application Programming Interface):
A set of defined rules that enable different software applications to communicate with each other.

### Microservices Architecture: 
An approach where a large application is built as a suite of small, independently deployable services.

### Monolithic Architecture: 
A traditional approach where all components of an application are combined into a single, tightly coupled unit.

### Spring Framework: A' comprehensive framework for building enterprise Java applications.
Spring Boot: Built on top of the Spring Framework, it simplifies the creation of stand-alone, production-ready Spring applications with minimal configuration.
Auto-configuration: Spring Boot automatically configures many aspects of your application based on the dependencies present.
Starter Dependencies: Pre-packaged sets of dependencies for common functionalities (e.g., spring-boot-starter-web, spring-boot-starter-data-jpa).


### Understanding Routers and navigators
"Users navigate from one page to another, while the router determines which page (or component) to display based on the user's interaction, such as clicking a button or selecting an option."
