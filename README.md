# Employee Management System (EMS) - Web Application

## üìå Introduction

The **Employee Management System (EMS)** is a web-based application developed to manage employee-related data efficiently. It allows users to perform basic operations on employee records through a user-friendly interface.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Add new employee details like **name, date of birth, email, phone number**, etc.
- **View** a list of all employees stored in the system.
- **Update** existing employee information if there are any changes.
- **Delete** employee records that are no longer needed.

## üóÉÔ∏è How It Works

1. The user fills out a form with employee details.
2. These details are sent to the backend and stored in a **database**.
3. The system provides buttons or options to **insert**, **update**, or **delete** employee data.
4. All data is displayed in a tabular format for easy viewing and management.

This project is a simple example of how CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are implemented in a web application using modern web development technologies.
