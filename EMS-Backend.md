- These are the terms that you should know before knowing about how java would function in the backend.

### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): 
The foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. Understand request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), status codes (200, 404, 500), headers.

### REST (Representational State Transfer):
An architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs are stateless, client-server, cacheable, etc.

### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): 
A lightweight data-interchange format. Widely used for sending data between a backend and frontend.

### API (Application Programming Interface):
A set of defined rules that enable different software applications to communicate with each other.

### Microservices Architecture: 
An approach where a large application is built as a suite of small, independently deployable services.

### Monolithic Architecture: 
A traditional approach where all components of an application are combined into a single, tightly coupled unit.

### Spring Framework: A' comprehensive framework for building enterprise Java applications.
Spring Boot: Built on top of the Spring Framework, it simplifies the creation of stand-alone, production-ready Spring applications with minimal configuration.
Auto-configuration: Spring Boot automatically configures many aspects of your application based on the dependencies present.
Starter Dependencies: Pre-packaged sets of dependencies for common functionalities (e.g., spring-boot-starter-web, spring-boot-starter-data-jpa).


### Understanding Routers and navigators
"Users navigate from one page to another, while the router determines which page (or component) to display based on the user's interaction, such as clicking a button or selecting an option."
