# Employee Management System (EMS) - Spring Boot Backend

A simple **Employee Management System (EMS)** backend built using **Java 17**, **Spring Boot 3**, and **MySQL**.  
Provides RESTful APIs for managing employee data and integrates with a frontend application.

---

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **Java 17**  
  Object-oriented programming language for building robust backend applications.

- **Spring Boot 3**  
  Framework to create production-ready Spring applications with minimal configuration.

- **Spring Data JPA**  
  Simplifies database operations and integrates with MySQL.

- **Spring REST API**  
  Enables communication between frontend and backend using HTTP and JSON.

- **OpenAPI / Swagger**  
  Auto-generates interactive API documentation for easy testing.

- **MySQL Database**  
  Stores structured employee data.

## üìñ Key Concepts

### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
- Foundation of data communication on the web.  
- Request methods: **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, **DELETE**  
- Status codes: **200**, **404**, **500**  
- Headers provide metadata like content type and authentication.

### REST (Representational State Transfer)
- Stateless, client-server architecture for building scalable APIs.  

### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
- Lightweight data-interchange format used between frontend and backend.  

### API (Application Programming Interface)
- Set of rules that allow different software systems to communicate.  

### Architecture Types
- **Monolithic:** All components tightly coupled in a single unit.  
- **Microservices:** Application built as small, independently deployable services.

### Spring Framework
- Comprehensive framework for enterprise Java applications.  

### Spring Boot Features
- Auto-configuration based on dependencies.  
- Starter dependencies (e.g., `spring-boot-starter-web`, `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`).  

### Routers and Navigators
- **Frontend:** Determines which page/component to display based on user interaction.  
- **Backend:** Handles requests to endpoints and sends appropriate responses.

## üõ† Workflow

1. Client sends an HTTP request (**GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, **DELETE**) to the API endpoint.  
2. **Controller** layer receives the request.  
3. **Service** layer processes business logic.  
4. **Repository** layer interacts with MySQL database using Spring Data JPA.  
5. Response is returned to the client in **JSON** format.

## üìÇ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Java 17, Spring Boot 3, Spring Data JPA, REST API  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **API Documentation:** Swagger (OpenAPI)
