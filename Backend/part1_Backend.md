# Java in backend

> The Backend language of the EMS project is "Java".


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


## Java

Java is a powerful programming language used in backend(the part of the website which you can't see, it contains the business logic of the project), it is like the brain of web development which handles data,business logic and talks to the backend.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


## Java EE

Java EE (Java Platform, Enterprise Edition) is a set of tools and specifications built on top of Core Java to help developers build large-scale, distributed, and enterprise-level applications.

```
EnterPrise Level Applications:


These are large scale software applications that run in a business/corporate environment.


These are built to serve the needs of an organisation rather than an individual.

```


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


## Servlets


These are the small java programs that run on a server and handle HTTP requests.

This is a low-level and old way of building backend logic.

Think of it like a waiter who takes orders(requests) and delivers food(responses).

## ðŸ’  Spring Framework

This is a light-weight java framework used to build java applications.

```
Framework:

This is like a ready made base for building software.

It saves time because we need not write the code from scratch.

It gives you pre-written code,tools and rules to follow.

You need to just add features on top of what is already provided.

It helps developers build apps faster and in an organised way.
